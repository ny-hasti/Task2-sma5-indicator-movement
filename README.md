# Task2-sma5-indicator-movement
This code creates a DataFrame with dates and closing prices, then manually calculates the 5-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) without using built-in functions. For each row, it sums the previous 5 close values and divides by 5. The result is added as a new SMA_5 column.
